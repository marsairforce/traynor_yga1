# Experimental preamp  

I tried to use the values from the AX84 amp site. 

Where changing the module of the preamp circuit could run each stage of the V1 in series (instead of having the two stages in parallel like it was in the YGA1)

I found this sound to be thing and weak. It went straight from clean tone to undesireable to much clipping and buzzing overdrive, like how an op-amp would sound almost.

This could be a lot because at the time I did this experiement I did not understand the rest of the circuit, and how the way the tone stack and power stage are set up before to work under a high head room clean amp setting.  The large capacitor and small resistor on the cathode of the preamp stage before worked well with this setup.

I ended up taking this module out and putting back the original circuit. I later did do a cascaded input stage option, but with a switch to change it, and then using the existing cathode bypass resistor and capacitor for the second stage.  I still get some oscillations at high gain settings, but it is for the most part usable. 

I kept this folder around for reference and amusement.
